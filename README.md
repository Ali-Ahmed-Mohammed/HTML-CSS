- The <head> section is used to provide information about a webpage.
- The p element is used to represent a paragraph. A paragraph can be one or many lines of text
- The em element is used to define emphasized text. By default, emphasized text is displayed in italic.
- The strong element is used to represent important content. Browsers, by default, render strong content in bold.
- The i and b elements are considered deprecated because HTML should not be used for styling. Thatâ€™s the role of CSS
- Headings are represented using h1 to h6. Every web page should have one and only one h1> element Headings should have a natural hierarchy and should not be skipped.
- Entities are used to display special characters such as angle brackets, copyright symbol, etc. The most important entities are: &nbsp; (non-breaking space), &lt; (less than sign), &gt; (greater than sign) and &copy; (copyright symbol
- The (anchor) element, with its href attribute, is used to create a hyperlink to web pages, locations in the same page, files and email addresses.
- The div and span elements are generic containers used for styling purposes. Divs are block-level elements, spans are inline elements. A block-level element starts on a new line and takes up the entire available horizontal space.
